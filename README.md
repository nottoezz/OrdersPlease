# Terminal Orders: A Horror Cooking Game

Welcome to **Terminal Orders**, a browser-based horror cooking game built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Three.js.

## 🎮 Game Overview

You wake up in a strange place. A terminal glows in the darkness, waiting for input...

In this game, you take on the role of a player trapped in a dimly-lit kitchen with only a computer terminal to take and complete strange food orders. Using the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/), you must:

- Enter ingredients to generate meal orders
- Complete orders by following cryptic preparation steps
- Survive the consequences of failing to cook correctly

The experience blends terminal-based gameplay, ambient horror audio, and eerie 3D visuals to deliver a unique interactive experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS**
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **Canvas API** for the terminal screen
- **TheMealDB API** for dynamic meal data
- **sessionStorage** for order persistence
- **Custom shaders, lighting effects, and post-processing**
