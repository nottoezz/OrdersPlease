Project Status: Incomplete

As of now, the project remains incomplete. While the core mechanics and foundation have been laid out, several key features and improvements are still pending. The current build may not represent the intended final experience and should be viewed as a work in progress.

Roadmap â€“ Planned Additions and Improvements:

Animations

Introduce smoother and more expressive animations to enhance interactivity and immersion.

Improved Sound Effects

Add higher quality, more contextually appropriate sound effects to enrich the atmosphere.

Better Hints

Implement a more intuitive hint system to guide the player without breaking immersion.

A Figure

Introduce a character or figure to add narrative weight or interactive depth to the gameplay.

An Ending

Develop a complete and satisfying ending to provide narrative closure and reward the player's journey.

Further updates and iterations will follow as development continues.
