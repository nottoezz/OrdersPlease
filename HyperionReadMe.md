# Terminal Orders – HyperionDev Capstone Project

This project was created as part of the HyperionDev Web Development course.

The core JavaScript functionality required for the capstone — including TheMealDB API integration, sessionStorage usage, DOM interaction, and order management — is implemented in the `js/TerminalInterface.js` file.

All required logic for:
- Taking and completing orders
- API data handling
- User input via terminal
- Persistent storage with sessionStorage

…is located in that single file for easy review and assessment.

Feel free to explore the rest of the project for additional features and styling.
